* `PEEK' for keeping the returned data in the kernel buffers
* `WAIT-ALL' for waiting until the entire buffer can be filled
* `DONT-WAIT' for making only the current call non-blocking

The first two values returned are the buffer and the number of elements that have been copied into the buffer.
For INTERNET DATAGRAM sockets, two additional values are returned: the host and port of the remote peer
from which the data was received.
For LOCAL DATAGRAM sockets, one additional values is returned: the filename of the remote peer
from which the data was received."))

`BUFFER' must be a vector that can be coerced to a (SIMPLE-ARRAY (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) *).
`START' and `END' are used a bounding index on `BUFFER'.
For disconnected datagram sockets, `REMOTE-HOST' and `REMOTE-PORT' or `REMOTE-FILENAME' are used
as destination for the data.

Some flags can also be passed to sendto(2):
* `OUT-OF-BAND' for receiving out-of-band data - only for stream sockets
* `DONT-WAIT' for making only the current call non-blocking
* `DONT-ROUTE' for sending only to hosts on directly connected networks, not using gateways
* `CONFIRM' for signalling progress on the link layer - only available on Linux and only with DATAGRAM sockets
* `MORE' for telling the kernel that there is more data to send - only available on Linux

Returns the number of bytes sent."))
